        <p>Jonathan Joseph James (December 12, 1983 – May 18, 2008) was an American hacker (a gray hat ethical hacker) who was the first juvenile incarcerated for cybercrime in the United States. The South Florida native was 15 years old at the time of the first offense and 16 years old on the date of his sentencing. He died at his Pinecrest, Florida home on May 18, 2008, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Between June and October of 1999, one of the most incredible episodes in the history of the computer crimes was carried out. The United States Department of Defense (DOD) discovered a number of intrusions to private companies, school systems, as well as DOD itself and even NASA. The interesting thing about all this is that these intrusions were the work of a young man of just 15 years of age.A native of the city of Miami, Jonathan James, who operated under the pseudonym of ‘C0mrade’, is considered one of the greatest hackers in history, thanks to his great ability to access private systems for entertainment. Between June 29 and 30, Jonathan managed to break NASA security and access 13 computers from where he stole software and information worth $ 1.7 million, which caused the agency to shut down their systems for 21 days, an action that would cost them $ 41,000 in repairs and losses.He was Jonatham James!</p>
